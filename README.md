# Econometrics_Method_Homework
This repository includes R code used for my homework assignment in the course Econometrics Methods. 
Assignment_1.R conducts estimation with an ordinal probit model with 4 estimators: MLE,NLLSE,Just-ID GMM, and Over-ID GMM.
Assignment_1_MC.R investigates the consistency and asymptotic normality performance of the 4 estimators through Monte-Carlo simulation.
